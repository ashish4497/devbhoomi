            Gangotri is one of Char Dhams of Uttarakhand, arranged on the banks
            of the heavenly Bhagirathi River. Gangotri is situated at an
            elevation of 3048 meters in the Himalayas of Uttarakhand, India.

            Gangotri is arranged in the northern portion of the Uttarkashi
            District and near the Indo-Tibetan border. It is around 300 km from
            Dehradun, 250 km from Rishikesh, and 105 km from Uttarkashi.

            The first Gangotri Temple was built by the Nepalese general “Amar
            Singh Thapa”. The stream is called Bhagirathi at the source and gets
            the name Ganga (the Ganges) from Devprayag onwards where it meets
            the Alaknanda. The root of the blessed stream is at Gaumukh, set in
            the Gangotri Glacier, and is a 19 km journey from Gangotri. The
            sanctuary is closed from Diwali day consistently and is reopened on
            Akshaya Tritiya.

            During this time, the icon of the goddess is kept at Mukhba town,
            close to Harsil. Ceremonial obligations of the sanctuary are
            administered by the Semwal group of pujaris. These pujaris hail from
            Mukhba town.
