            It is believed that beginning your Char Dham Yatra from Haridwar is
            the best option if you are planning to reach Uttarakhand by train.
            Because starting from Haridwar includes Haridwar itself followed by
            Rishikesh and other places and you will not need to explore Haridwar
            at the end of your tour. Another reason is that Haridwar is also
            known as the gateway to Holy Char Dham and starting from Haridwar
            makes the tour extra positive.

            If you are planning to take a flight then you can plan your tour
            either from Delhi or Dehradun. The only difference is that both
            places are 250 km apart and you will need a minimum of 12 days if
            you start the tour from Delhi and a minimum of 10 days if you start
            your tour from Dehradun.
          </p>

            There are other time-saving options also like Char Dham yatra by
            helicopter within 2 days and 5 days.
