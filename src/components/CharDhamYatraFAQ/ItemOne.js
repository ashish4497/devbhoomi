            The Char Dham Yatra is a pilgrimage tour to the four sacred places
            located in the foothills of the great Himalayas of the Indian state
            Uttarakhand. The main goal of this sacred journey is to cover four
            holy destinations known as Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath, and
            Badrinath.
          </p>
          <p>
            These four destinations are located above the clouds in the Garhwal
            region of the Uttarakhand state of India. Gangotri and Badrinath are
            accessible by road, but Yamunotri and Kedarnath are not completely
            accessible by road. For Kedarnath, you will need to trek for 16 km
            whereas for Yamunotri you will need to trek for 6 km.
