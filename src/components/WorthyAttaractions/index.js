              3.2- How And Where To Reach For Char Dham Yatra Tour?
            </h4>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "14px" }}>
              As per the temple visiting sequence in Char Dham Yatra, people do
              Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath, and then Badrianth in the last.
              The most nearest railway stations are Rishikesh, Haridwar, and
              Dehradun and the only airport is Jolly Grant (DED) airport. You
              can take a flight to Dehradun or a train to
              Haridwar/Rishikesh/Dehradun to quickstart your Char Dham Yatra
              tour. Besides this, you can also plan to reach Delhi and we make
              arrangements from there too but requires two more nights to be
              added to the tour. Here are the best Char Dham routes which
              provide magnificent sights along the way, you can follow these
              routes for a complete Char Dham Yatra or you can also plan them
              individually or in a pair, which are also referred to as Ek Dham
              Yatra Packages and Do Dham Yatra Packages.

              3.3- What Are Essential Packings For Char Dham Yatra?
            </h4>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "14px" }}>
              Packing for the Char Dham Yatra requires careful planning due to
              the challenging weather and terrain. Essentials include warm
              clothing such as thermals, sweaters, and jackets, as temperatures
              can drop significantly, especially at night. Layering is key to
              adjusting to changing weather. Comfortable and sturdy trekking
              shoes are crucial for the rocky, steep paths, along with extra
              socks to keep feet warm and dry.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p style={{ fontSize: "14px" }}>
              Rain gear, including waterproof jackets and umbrellas, is
              essential, as unexpected rain is common. Basic medications, first
              aid, and any personal medicines are a must, as pharmacies are
              scarce. Since high-altitude travel can cause health issues, pack
              items like energy bars, hydration salts, and a portable oxygen
              canister. Other essentials include a durable backpack, water
              bottle, flashlight, personal hygiene items, sunscreen, and
              sunglasses to protect against the sunâ€™s intensity. Keeping a
              lightweight power bank is also wise, as charging options can be
              limited. Lastly, carry personal ID, cash, and copies of necessary
              travel permits.
