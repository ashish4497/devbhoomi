              2.1- Which Is The Best Season For Char Dham Yatra 2025?
            </h4>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "14px" }}>
              <b>Best Season:</b> Usually the Char Dham Yatra begins from the
              mid-April and lasts up to October last. So, the Char Dham Yatra
              has only seven months to play and some years it has only six.
              Visitors get only these months to witness the divine temples
              because temples get closed whole winters due to heavy snowfall.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p style={{ fontSize: "14px" }}>
              <b>Summers:</b> April, May, June are the peak season months.
              Weather feels pleasant over the Himalayan towns when it's burning
              in the busty cities. Heading to Himalayan peaks in summers sounds
              exciting but it gets very crowded and people suffer in jams.
            </p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "14px" }}>
              <b>Monsoon:</b> July and August months rain here, weather gets
              very pleasant, clear and less crowded but involves certain risks
              of landslides, roadblocks, floods, and cloudbursts.
            </p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "14px" }}>
              <b>Winters:</b> September and October months can be considered as
              the ideal time to plan for this holy Himalayan Char Dham
              Pilgrimage. Sep and Oct months are the start of the winters where
              September is quite pleasant but October can be quite cold. If you
              get lucky, a snowfall can also be witnessed at Dhams in the month
              of October. So if you are not afraid of a bit cold then this is
              the time for you.

              2.2- How Many Days A Char Dham Yatra Tour Takes?
            </h4>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "14px" }}>
              <b>Char Dham Yatra Duration:</b> The Char Dham Yatra takes a
              minimum of ten days if you do it from Haridwar/Rishikesh/Dehradun.
              People also do it in nine days from Haridwar/Rishikesh/Dehradun
              but itâ€™s a very hectic plan which leads to reaching late at the
              given destinations. The driver drives the vehicle all day,
              covering sightseeing, but not having proper rest, which makes it
              risky as well. Considering safety and comfort, we have excluded
              this nine-day Char Dham tour from our Char Dham Tour's list.
              Besides this, we made more comfortable, peaceful, and relaxing
              Char Dham Yatra packages by merging nearby beautiful places which
              really worth a visit.

              A Char Dham Yatra tour takes a minimum of 10 days if you plan to
              start and end at Haridwar/Rishikesh/Dehradun, but you have to keep
              your arrival time before noon and departure time in the late
              evening. This way, you can plan a comfortable 10 Days Char Dham
              Yatra Itinerary but it will still not include the stays in
              Haridwar and Rishikesh but a break can be taken while passing them
              if time permits. To include stays in Haridwar and Rishikesh you
              will further need to add more nights in your Char Dham expedition,

              2.3- Where To Make Halts For A Comfortable Char Dham Yatra?
            </h4>
            <p style={{ fontSize: "14px" }}>
              Where should be your first halt in the Char Dham Expedition? Well,
              it completely depends on the origin of the tour. We pick the
              places according to the secquense of the temple visits, legends
              say that the Yamunotri should be the first Dham followed by
              Gangotri, Kedarnath and Badrinath. Let's plan it for ex
              Dehradun/Haridwar/Rishikesh first, if your train/flight's
              deboarding time is before noon then you can straight proceed to
              Barkot for Yamunotri Dham.
              <br />
              <br />
              If your arrival is late then you can put yourself in
              Haridwar/Rishikesh for the first night and start for Barkot on the
              next day. Keep two nights at Barkot for a full day visit to
              Yamunotri Dham, then you will move to Uttarkashi for two nights
              and having a full day visit to Gangotri from there. Next you stay
              at Guptkashi/Phata for one night which is near Kedarnath. The next
              night you will need at Kedarnath and then coming to Chopta for one
              night halt. From Chopta we put one night straight at Badrinath.
              Badrinath darshan and Mana village tour takes time so we put the
              last night at Rudraprayag to reach before the sunset. Post
              Rudraprayag night you will come back to Haridwar/Rishikesh
              /Dehradun and from there, you can take your train/flight back to
              your place.

              Similarly, if planning a Char Dham Expedition from Delhi then you
              just need to put two nights in the above plan. One night in the
              start at Haridwar/Rishikesh/Mussoorie and one night in the last at
              Haridwar/Rishikesh will make this tour super comfortable.
